I prefer Liquibase DB evolutions to play 2.0 Evolutions mechanism
This is simple play 2.0 plugin for liquibase usage.

Suppose main script files for all DBs used are at conf/liquibase/--dbName--/modules.xml

Use contexts in your scripts to manage test and prod data and schema. Available contexts are:
 1. "test" - for test mode
 2. "dev" - for dev mode
 3. "prod" - for production mode

In dev and production mode use applyLiquibase.<dbName>=true properties to apply scripts.

Simply publish-local with sbt and add dependency to your play 2.0 project "play" %% "play20-liquibase" % "1.0"
